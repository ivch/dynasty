I use this project as the playground for some new ideas.

As an example: I wrote a lot of monolithic PHP applications and created lots of microservices in my Go career. I don't like writing monolithic applications in Go.

Inspired by [this](https://inconshreveable.com/10-07-2015/the-neomonolith/) article I, for a long time, wanted to try creating this "neomonolith" application.

Not a bad idea so far :) 

Also, this if my first try of Github Actions and Traefik.
